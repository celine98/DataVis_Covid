# DataVis_Covid

As part of the INF552 (Data Visualisation) course that I took during my third year at Ecole polytechnique, I created a Covid-19 data visualisation dashboard using Tableau. 

The dashboard is available on this link: https://tinyurl.com/ybuj93uz

You can find more info about the different visualisations in the **Report.pdf** file.
